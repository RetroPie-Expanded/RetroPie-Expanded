rp_module_help="Mouse or mouse emulation through xboxdrv is required. You need to copy your Theme Hospital game data into $romdir/ports/$md_id/ and when starting up the game for the first time, select the directory. The colors and fonts could have bad colors here making it difficult, so alternatively you can edit /opt/retropie/configs/ports/corsixth/config.txt to change the path the data files are at and then restart the game."
